# BetterUI :: Gamepad Interface Improvements
Elder Scrolls: Online addon (written in LUA) which improves the gamepad interface on PC and makes drastic changes to the underlying interface.


---

## Modules
* [Enhanced Inventory]
  * Redeveloped Inventory interface which allows for great customizability, and matching of the Keyboard functionality (such as a "Junk" feature)
* [Enhanced Banking]
  * Programmed from the ground-up to match the [Enhanced Inventory] interface style, and is based wholly on my own code - it is future-proof!
* [Enhanced Guild Store]
  * Features to improve the restrictive default Gamepad design including `MasterMerchant` integration, unit prices, and an expanded row view for detailed 
  guild browsing.


## Contributors

You are free to request pulls into this Git repo, and they will pretty much always be accepted (unless it goes against future changes planned). 

I am seriously in need of translators, so if you speak ANY other language (apart from English), please message me and I can integrate the strings!
